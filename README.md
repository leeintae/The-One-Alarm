# The-One-Alarm

This project was conducted in a class called "System Programming" of Ajou University.
As a college student studying computer engineering in university, 
"System Programming" class was a very meaningful and challenging project. 
Because it was my first experience that I made somewhat useful thing since I've studied computer engineering.

Detail things about project are written in Report.pdf file.
